## 2. Literature Survey

### 2.1 Overview of AI Assistants

AI assistants have evolved significantly from rule-based systems to advanced neural network-based language models. This section explores the historical development of AI assistants, from early systems like ELIZA to modern conversational agents powered by large language models.

The evolution of AI assistants can be traced through several key phases:

1. **Rule-based systems (1960s-1990s)**: Early conversational agents like ELIZA (1966) used pattern matching and predefined rules to simulate conversation. These systems had no actual understanding of language or context.

2. **Statistical methods (1990s-2010s)**: Systems began incorporating statistical models for natural language processing, allowing for more flexible responses based on probabilities rather than strict rules.

3. **Neural network approaches (2010s)**: The introduction of neural networks and deep learning enabled more sophisticated language processing, with systems like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa reaching mass consumer adoption.

4. **Transformer-based models (2018-present)**: The development of the Transformer architecture and subsequent models like BERT, GPT, and others revolutionized NLP capabilities, enabling unprecedented language understanding and generation.

5. **Multimodal assistants (2022-present)**: Integration of text, image, and other modalities into single systems that can process and generate various types of content.

Current commercial systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Bard, and Anthropic's Claude represent the state-of-the-art in AI assistants, with capabilities that approach human-level performance in many language tasks.

### 2.2 Foundation Models and LLMs

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the foundation of modern AI assistants. These models, trained on vast corpora of text, can generate human-like text, understand context, and perform a wide range of language tasks.

Foundation models are characterized by:

1. **Scale**: Modern LLMs contain billions to trillions of parameters, enabling them to capture complex patterns in language data.

2. **Architecture**: Most foundation models use Transformer architectures, with attention mechanisms that allow them to process relationships between tokens in a sequence.

3. **Pre-training and fine-tuning**: Models are typically pre-trained on diverse corpora using self-supervised learning, then fine-tuned for specific applications.

4. **Emergent abilities**: As models scale in size and training data, they exhibit abilities that weren't explicitly trained for, such as reasoning, few-shot learning, and task adaptation.

5. **Transferability**: Knowledge learned during pre-training transfers across a wide range of tasks and domains.

The development of foundation models has accelerated rapidly since the introduction of GPT-3 in 2020, with each new generation showing significant improvements in capabilities, efficiency, and reasoning abilities. Recent models like Llama 3.3, Qwen, Mixtral, and Gemma represent diverse approaches to model architecture, with varying parameter counts, training methodologies, and optimization strategies.

### 2.3 Reasoning in AI Models

Recent advancements in AI have focused on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models. This section examines models like Qwen QWQ and DeepSeek R1 that explicitly show their reasoning processes, making AI decision-making more transparent and trustworthy.

Key developments in reasoning capabilities include:

1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Prompting techniques that encourage models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing final answers, improving performance on complex reasoning tasks.

2. **Self-consistency**: Methods that generate multiple reasoning paths and select the most consistent answer, reducing errors in mathematical and logical reasoning.

3. **Explicit reasoning models**: Models specifically designed to expose their reasoning process, like Qwen QWQ (Query While Question) and DeepSeek R1, which show step-by-step thought processes leading to conclusions.

4. **Tree of Thoughts**: Advanced reasoning approaches that explore multiple reasoning branches simultaneously, allowing for backtracking and re-evaluation when initial reasoning paths prove unsuccessful.

5. **Verification and reflection**: Techniques where models verify their own reasoning by checking intermediate steps, improving accuracy in complex problem-solving scenarios.

Research shows that exposing reasoning processes not only improves accuracy for complex tasks but also enhances user trust, as users can identify and correct flaws in the AI's reasoning. This transparency forms a foundation for collaborative problem-solving between humans and AI systems.

### 2.4 Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent systems involve multiple AI agents working together to solve complex problems. This approach mimics human team collaboration and allows for specialization among different agents.

Key aspects of multi-agent systems include:

1. **Agent specialization**: Individual agents focus on specific domains or skills, allowing for depth of expertise in particular areas.

2. **Communication protocols**: Structured methods for agents to exchange information, including formats for requests, responses, and feedback loops.

3. **Task decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into subtasks that can be delegated to specialized agents.

4. **Coordination mechanisms**: Methods for orchestrating agent interactions, including sequential workflows, parallel processing, and hierarchical structures.

5. **Emergent collaboration**: The ability of multiple agents to achieve outcomes that exceed what any individual agent could accomplish alone.

Recent research and implementations like AutoGen, CrewAI, and LangGraph have demonstrated the effectiveness of multi-agent approaches for tasks ranging from creative content generation to complex problem-solving. These frameworks provide structured approaches to agent collaboration, including role definition, communication channels, and coordination strategies.

The multi-agent paradigm represents a significant evolution beyond single-model approaches, enabling more robust problem-solving through specialization and collaboration.

### 2.5 Comparison of Existing Solutions

This section provides a comparative analysis of existing AI assistant platforms, including their features, limitations, and technical approaches.

| Platform | Model Access | Reasoning Transparency | Specialized Agents | Multi-Agent Support | Conversation Memory | UI Customization |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Limited selection | Limited | GPTs (custom) | No | Yes | Limited |
| Claude (Anthropic) | Single model | Limited | No | No | Yes | Limited |
| Bard/Gemini (Google) | Limited selection | No | No | No | Yes | Limited |
| Perplexity | Multiple sources | Search citations | No | Limited | Limited | No |
| GitHub Copilot | Specialized | No | Code only | No | Limited | Limited |
| Skynet (Our System) | Multiple models | Explicit reasoning | 8+ specialized agents | Yes | Yes | Extensive |

Most existing solutions focus on single-model interactions with limited transparency into the reasoning process. While some platforms offer specialized capabilities (like GitHub Copilot for code), few provide a comprehensive framework for model selection, reasoning transparency, and multi-agent collaboration.

Commercial platforms typically prioritize ease of use and accessibility over advanced features like model selection or reasoning visibility. Open-source alternatives often offer more flexibility but require technical expertise to deploy and customize.

Skynet addresses these limitations by providing a unified interface for multiple models, transparent reasoning processes, and structured multi-agent workflows, while maintaining accessibility through a user-friendly web interface.

However, commercial platforms currently offer advantages in:

1. **Content Filtering**: More robust safety measures and content filtering capabilities to prevent misuse and harmful outputs.
2. **Knowledge Freshness**: Access to more recent training data and retrieval-augmented generation for up-to-date information.
3. **Enterprise Integration**: Better support for enterprise security requirements and integration with corporate systems.
4. **Scalability**: More robust infrastructure for handling large numbers of users simultaneously.
5. **Continuous Updates**: Regular model improvements and feature updates backed by substantial resources.

### 4.2 Database Design

The application uses a combination of local storage mechanisms:

1. **Session Storage**: For storing conversation history during the user's session
2. **Local Storage**: For storing user preferences such as dark/light mode

The data model for conversations includes:
- Unique conversation ID
- Conversation title
- Array of messages (with role, content, and timestamp)
- Creation and update timestamps

This client-side storage approach ensures user data remains private and avoids the need for server-side authentication while still providing conversation persistence within a browser session.

#### Suggested ER Diagram for Data Model

For documentation purposes, an Entity-Relationship diagram could be created to represent the conceptual data model:

```
┌───────────────────┐       ┌───────────────────┐

                                     │
                            ┌────────▼──────────┐
                            │      Message      │

                            │ reasoning         │
                            │ created_at        │
                            └───────────────────┘
```

This diagram shows the relationships between:
- Users (who have many conversations)
- Conversations (which belong to a user and have many messages)
- Messages (which belong to a conversation)

Additional ER diagrams could be created to model:

1. **Agent Relationships Diagram**
```
┌───────────────────┐       ┌───────────────────┐

└───────────────────┘       │ description       │
                            └───────────────────┘
```

These ER diagrams help visualize the relationships between different entities in the system, though in the current implementation, these are maintained in client-side storage rather than a traditional database.

6. **Storage Module**: Handles data persistence
   - Conversation storage
   - User preference management
   - State synchronization

Each module is designed with clear boundaries and responsibilities, allowing for independent development and testing.

### 4.5 AI Model Integration

The system integrates with several AI models through the Groq API:

1. **Foundation Models**:
   - Llama 3.3 70B
   - Gemma 2 9B
   - Mixtral 8x7B
   - Llama 3.1 8B

2. **Reasoning Models**:
   - Qwen QWQ 32B

   - DeepSeek R1 (Llama 70B)

The integration architecture includes:

- **API Client**: Handles authentication, request formatting, and error handling
- **Response Streaming**: Processes chunked responses for real-time display
- **Reasoning Detection**: Identifies and properly formats reasoning output
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Handles API errors and provides graceful degradation

The model integration layer is abstracted from the rest of the application, allowing for easy addition of new models or API providers in the future.

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1 Frontend Implementation

The frontend is implemented using React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. Key implementation details include:

#### Component Structure

The application uses a component-based architecture with the following main components:

- `App`: The root component that manages routing and global state
- `ChatArea`: Displays the conversation messages
- `ChatInput`: Handles user input and submission
- `MessageBubble`: Renders individual messages with Markdown support
- `ConversationSidebar`: Manages conversation history
- `SettingsPanel`: Provides user preference controls
- `AgentsPage`: Displays available specialized agents
- `SuperagentsPage`: Interface for multi-agent workflows
- `LandingPage`: Homepage with feature highlights

```tsx
<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage isDarkMode={isDarkMode} />} />
    <Route path="/chat" element={<ChatView />} />
    <Route path="/profile" element={<ProfilePage isDarkMode={isDarkMode} toggleDarkMode={toggleDarkMode} />} />
    <Route path="/agents" element={<AgentsPage isDarkMode={isDarkMode} />} />
    <Route path="/superagents" element={<SuperagentsPage />} />
    <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />
  </Routes>
</Router>
```

### 5.2 Backend Implementation

The application primarily uses client-side processing with direct API integration rather than a traditional backend. Key implementation aspects include:

#### API Integration

The Groq API is used to access various AI models:

```typescript
export async function sendMessageToGroq(
  messages: Message[],
  model: string = 'llama3-70b-8192'
): Promise<{content: string}> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(GROQ_API_URL, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model,
        messages,
        temperature: 0.7,
        max_tokens: 4096
      })
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorText = await response.text();
      throw new Error(`Groq API error: ${response.status} - ${errorText}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json() as GroqResponse;
    return { content: data.choices[0].message.content };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling Groq API:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 5.3 Database Implementation

The application uses a combination of session storage and local storage for data persistence:

```typescript
// Save dark mode preference to localStorage when it changes
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('darkMode', JSON.stringify(isDarkMode));
}, [isDarkMode]);

// Save conversations to sessionStorage when they change
useEffect(() => {
  sessionStorage.setItem('conversations', JSON.stringify(conversations));
}, [conversations]);
```

Custom hooks like `useLocalStorage` and `useSessionStorage` provide a React-friendly interface for persistent storage:

```typescript
export function useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T): [T, (value: T) => void] {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error reading localStorage key "${key}":`, error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value: T) => {
    try {
      const valueToStore = value instanceof Function ? value(storedValue) : value;
      setStoredValue(valueToStore);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(valueToStore));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error setting localStorage key "${key}":`, error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

### 5.4 AI Model Implementation

#### Basic Chat Model Integration

The application integrates with various models through the Groq API:

```typescript
const streamMessageFromGroq = async (
  messages: Message[],
  onChunk: (chunk: string, type: 'content' | 'reasoning') => void,
  onComplete: () => void,
  modelId: string = 'llama3-70b-8192',
  reasoningFormat: 'parsed' | 'raw' | 'hidden' = 'parsed',
  systemPrompt?: string
): Promise<void> => {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

#### LangChain Integration

For more complex workflows, the application uses LangChain:

```typescript
export const createResearcherChain = (topic: string) => {
  const researcherPrompt = PromptTemplate.fromTemplate(`
    You're a research helper. Look into the topic: {topic}.
    Give a few bullet points with easy-to-read facts, stats, and some background details.
    
    Topic: {topic}
  `);

  const researcherModel = createAgentChatModel("deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b");
  const outputParser = new StringOutputParser();

  return RunnableSequence.from([
    {
      topic: () => topic
    },
    researcherPrompt,
    researcherModel,
    outputParser
  ]);
};
```

### 5.5 Multi-Agent Implementation

The application implements a multi-agent system using a CrewAI-inspired approach:

```typescript
export class Crew {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  members: CrewMember[];
  
  // Implementation details...
  
  async executeSequentialWorkflow(
    initialTask: string,
    callback?: (member: CrewMember, output: string) => void
  ): Promise<string> {
    let context = "";
    let result = "";
    
    for (const member of this.members) {
      try {
        result = await member.executeTask(initialTask, context);
        context += `\n\n${member.name} (${member.role}) output:\n${result}\n\n`;
        
        if (callback) {
          callback(member, result);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error in workflow at member ${member.name}:`, error);
        throw error;
      }
    }
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

#### B.4 Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues**
- Error: "GROQ API key is not set"
  - Solution: Ensure you've created a `.env` file with your API key
  - Solution: Check that the API key is valid and has proper permissions

**Response Timeouts**
- Error: "API request timed out"
  - Solution: Check your internet connection
  - Solution: Try a different model with faster response times

**UI Display Issues**
- Problem: UI elements overlapping or incorrectly sized
  - Solution: Try clearing your browser cache
  - Solution: Refresh the page to reload all styles

**Storage Limitations**
- Problem: Conversations not saving
  - Solution: Clear some older conversations to free up space
  - Solution: Export important conversations to preserve them

### C. API Documentation

#### C.1 Groq API Integration

The system uses the Groq API to access various AI models. Below is the API interface specification:

**Endpoint**: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`

**Method**: POST

**Headers**:
- `Content-Type`: application/json
- `Authorization`: Bearer [GROQ_API_KEY]

**Request Body Parameters**:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| model | string | Model ID (e.g., 'llama-3.3-70b-versatile') |
| messages | array | Array of message objects with role and content |
| temperature | number | Controls randomness (0-1) |
| max_tokens | number | Maximum tokens in response |
| reasoning_format | string | (Optional) For reasoning models: 'parsed', 'raw', or 'hidden' |
| stream | boolean | (Optional) Enable streaming responses |

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 4096
}
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": "completion-abc123",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### C.2 Reasoning Models API

For reasoning-capable models, the API returns an additional `reasoning` field:

**Example Request**:
```json
{
  "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is 12 + 15?"}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "reasoning_format": "parsed"
}
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "id": "completion-xyz789",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The sum of 12 and 15 is 27."
      },
      "reasoning": "To find the sum of 12 and 15, I need to add these two numbers together.\n\n12 + 15 = 27\n\nTherefore, the answer is 27."
    }
  ]
}
```
